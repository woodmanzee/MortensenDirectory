# MortensenDirectory

### Purpose
For years the Mortensen family has had a printed directory, which often falls out of date quickly and has one or two errors already existing at print. This typically is hard to keep track of and hard to update. Recently this has been converted into a Google Doc, which is a helpful tool but is also often forgotten. This web app seeks to host the directory in an easy to remember and easily navigable location.
